# KD README


# my code will require a geopandas installation
# terminal commands to install geopandas here: 
# pip install geopandas
# pip install geopandas fiona

# my code will require plotly express to function properly (to generate map plots properly)
# install plotly
# pip install plotly
# pip install plotly_express


# plotly geopandas and plotly will need two-letter state codes to plot maps properly
# dataset to map state names to state codes so we can create a choropleth map (first plot)
# link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinrwong/us-states-to-abbreviations
# renamed to states_to_codes.csv

# geopandas and plotly will need shape files to draw out state polygons for each US state properly
# state shape file to draw out state shapes using plotly express(link will start a download)
