# Project 1: Mental Health Analysis in the Tech Industry
## Overview
    In this project, we worked collaboratively to find and analyze a dataset related to mental health in the tech industry. The primary goal of this project was to explore various aspects of mental health working in the tech field. We analyzed survey data to identify trends, correlations, and insights that shed light on the state of mental health in the tech industry. 

## Project Focus: Mental Health in Tech
    The tech industry is known for long hours at desks and high-pressure work environments. My analysis revolved around investigating how anonymity affects mental health by examining survey data collected from industry professionals. I searched for patterns and trends that might indicate a connection between mental health and work-related factors that impact on employees' mental health.

## Analysis
    My analysis dove into the perceptions of self-employed and employed individuals regarding mental health disclosure and its potential impact on their careers.
        ## Self-Employed Insights
            A majority responded with "No, because it would impact negatively." This response indicates a noteworthy level of apprehension among self-employed individuals when it comes to revealing mental health disorders to clients or business contacts. Further analysis within this group focused on those who responded negatively due to anticipated negative impacts. This portion of the data was examined to determine how many of them experienced negative or positive outcomes after disclosure. This confirmed their concern, indicating that their apprehension was justified, as majority of them have in fact experienced negative impacts. 
        ## Employed Insights
            In comparison with self-employed individuals, those employed were asked about the protection of anonymity when seeking employer-provided resources. Similar to the self-employed group, a trend of uncertainty was apparent. Responses predominantly included "I don't know", indicating that employed individuals also uncertain.
        ## Self-Employed and Employed
          Both self-employed and employed individuals indicated a trend of uncertainty in disclosing mental health disorders to their co-workers, with "maybe" being the dominant response. The trend also continued when considering whether co-workers/employees would view them more negatively if they knew about their mental health issues. 
          When both groups were asked if identifying as a person with a mental health issue would hurt their career, I found a strong correlation between the two. What stood out the most is the level of uncertainty in disclosing such information. Most of these responses were not only "Maybe" but also "Yes, I think it would." This suggests that individuals perceive potential negative effects on their career if they were to be identified with a mental health issue.
## Conclusion
    In conclusion, this analysis provides valuable insights into the perceptions of self-employed and employed individuals regarding mental health and its impact on their careers. The findings emphasize the importance of addressing mental health stigma and promoting open conversations within both self-employment and traditional employment settings. By recognizing and addressing these concerns, we can work towards creating more inclusive and supportive workplaces that prioritize the well-being of all employees.
